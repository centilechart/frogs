# FROGS calculator, version 1.0, June 2024

The Fetal Region-specific Optimised Growth Standard (FROGS) is a method for calculating fetal birthweight centiles utilising the shape of the fetal (ultrasound-based) Hadlock curve. It is region-specific; adjusting for the mean birthweight and standard deviation of babies born at term in the local population to which it is applied. It provides an exact centile for each gestational day and can be sex-specific. Further, FROGS provides an ‘estimate range’ for the estimated fetal weight centile, assuming a +/- 10% ultrasound measurement error.
